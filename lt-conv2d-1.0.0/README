This program uses two implementations of 2dconvolution. The sliding window algorithm and 8-bit Toeplitz are both implemented. The sliding window algorithm can be used to test the implementation of 8b-Toeplitz. The test is done at the beginning of the program output 


The 2d-convolution "sliding window" method:
 3  7  6  0  0

The 2d-convolution Toeplitz matrix multiplication method:
 3  7  6  0  0
 3  9 13  2  0
 9 10 13  1  0
 9  0  9  6  0
 0  9  6  3  0


One can see by inspection that the two are equivalent. 


The final output is the 2d convolution of all user defined inputs over each channel (e.g. 3 inputs corresponding to RGB), and their respective kernels. 

The 2d-convolution Toeplitz matrix multiplication method for multiple input channels and kernels:
 6 14 12  0  0
 6 18 26  4  0
18 20 26  2  0
18  0 18 12  0
 0 18 12  6  0

Each convolution is summed together to synthesize the final output. 


The correctness of both algorithms can also be proven mathematically. The proof, however, is omitted here.
